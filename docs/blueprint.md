# **App Name**: FairDesk

## Core Features:

- Calendar View: Displays a monthly view with seat assignments for each working day.
- Manual Override: Allows users to propose seat changes for a specific day; requires 2-out-of-3 approvals to take effect. Utilizes reasoning as a tool to alert user of seat change status

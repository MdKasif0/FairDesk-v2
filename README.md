**FairDesk** is a Progressive Web App designed to automate and democratize office seating arrangements. It ensures fairness through a smart rotation algorithm, accommodates personal needs with features like seat locking, and adds a touch of fun with an optional randomizer. Built with Next.js and powered by Google's Gemini AI, FairDesk brings transparency and collaboration to your workspace.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Smart Seat Rotation**: Automatically rotates seats on a daily basis, skipping weekends and holidays to maintain a fair and consistent cycle.
- **Manual Overrides with Approvals**: Users can request to swap seats with a teammate for a day, requiring approval from other group members.
- **Seat Locking**: Lock a specific seat for a day for personal or medical reasons, which the rotation algorithm will respect.
- **Randomizer Mode**: Shuffle today's seating arrangement for a fun, spontaneous change of scenery.
- **Full History & Traceability**: View a complete chronological history of all past seating arrangements.
- **AI-Powered Notifications**: Receive friendly, AI-generated alerts on the status of your seat change requests.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable on any device (iOS, Android, Desktop) with offline support for a fast, native-app-like experience.
- **Responsive & Themeable**: A clean, mobile-first design with support for both light and dark modes.
